1. <details><summary><strong>Homomorphic Encryption</strong></summary><blockquote class="def">This is a form of encryption that allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without needing to decrypt it first. The result, when decrypted, will be the same as if the computations were performed on the original data. It's a game-changer for secure data processing and cloud computing.</blockquote></details>
2. <details><summary><strong>Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC)</strong></summary><blockquote> SMPC enables multiple parties to collaboratively compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private. In other words, the parties can work together to find an answer without revealing their individual data.</blockquote></details>
3. <details><summary><strong>Onion Routing</strong></summary><blockquote> Popularized by the Tor network, onion routing is a technique for anonymous communication over a computer network. It involves messages being encrypted and transmitted through a series of network nodes, called onion routers, which peel away layers of encryption one at a time, like the layers of an onion. The final node decrypts the message and sends it to the destination, ensuring anonymity for both the sender and receiver.</blockquote></details>
4. <details><summary><strong>Differential Privacy</strong></summary><blockquote> This technology adds statistical noise to datasets,allowing data analysts to draw conclusions from the data without risking the privacy of individual data points. It's commonly used for protecting user data when sharing aggregated information.</blockquote></details>
5. <details><summary><strong>Private Information Retrieval (PIR)</strong></summary><blockquote> PIR is a protocol that enables users to retrieve specific information from a database without the database server learning which piece of data was requested. This protects user privacy when accessing sensitive information.</blockquote></details>
6. <details><summary><strong>Oblivious RAM (ORAM)</strong></summary><blockquote> ORAM is a cryptographic protocol that allows a client to access a remote storage server without revealing the access pattern or which data is being accessed. This ensures data privacy by preventing the server from learning sensitive information about the user's activities.</blockquote></details>
7. <details><summary><strong>Zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs)</strong></summary><blockquote>zk-SNARKs are a form of zero-knowledge proof that allows one party to prove to another that a given statement is true without revealing any information about the statement itself, except for the fact that it's true. zk-SNARKs are particularly useful in blockchain applications, where they can be used to verify transactions without revealing their contents.</blockquote></details>
8. <details><summary><strong>Confidential Transactions</strong></summary><blockquote> This is a cryptographic technique used in somecrypto currencies, like Monero and Zcash, to hide transaction amounts and keep them confidential. This is achieved using advanced cryptographic techniques such as Pedersen commitments and range proofs, providing increased privacy for users.</blockquote></details>
9. <details><summary><strong>Attribute-based Encryption (ABE)</strong></summary><blockquote> ABE is a cryptographic scheme that allows data to be encrypted with specific attributes. Only users who possess a matching set of attributes, defined by a decryption policy, can decrypt the encrypted data. This enables fine-grained access control and ensures that only authorized parties can access sensitive information.</blockquote></details>
10. <details><summary><strong>Mix Networks</strong></summary><blockquote> Mix networks are a type of anonymous communication system thatuses a chain of proxy servers, or mixes, to shuffle and re-encrypt messages as they pass through the network. This makes it difficult for an adversary to trace the source of a message or the intended recipient, offering enhanced privacy for users.</blockquote></details>
